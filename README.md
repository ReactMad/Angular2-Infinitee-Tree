Challenge

TODO:
Fork this codepen into your own codepen and make all mentioned below changes there
Implement infinite tree to show 'data' (test data already defined below, should be done in AppComponent without additional component)
Component should support any number of nested levels
Show item label (render 'termHtml' markup if exists or 'term' otherwise) and count
Add Expand/Collapse for all levels. Use '+'/'-' symbols for them
Make UI as simple as possible
